# Sacchon

Sacchon is a diabetes management web application in which doctors look for 
patients who need advice. Every patient that a doctor consults with as well as
newly registered patients are both visible to them. Patients who are being 
consulted by a doctor cannot be seen by other doctors. 
The new patients can be seen by any doctor.
When a doctor decides to consult a new patient, that doctor becomes the 
patient's exclusive caretaker.
Patients of a doctor who quits the system are once more accessible 
to other doctors for consultation. Previous consultations with these patients 
have continued to refer to the departing physician.
A warning must be sent to the patient as soon as they log into the 
system if a doctor updates a consultation so that they are aware that 
certain crucial data has to be evaluated.
